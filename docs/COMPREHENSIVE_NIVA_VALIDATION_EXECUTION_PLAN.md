# üöÄ COMPREHENSIVE NIVA VALIDATION EXECUTION PLAN
## Following BULLETPROOF_VALIDATION_PLAN.md Guidelines

### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
Based on breakthrough NIVA zero-shot results (55.2% success vs 39.0% DR+GAN), we will:
1. Create comprehensive testing & results documentation
2. Conduct thorough code audit for bulletproof compliance  
3. Analyze DR/DR+GAN improvement opportunities with larger datasets
